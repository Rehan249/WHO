            World Health Organization (WHO) data reveals that ONE in FOUR people are affected by mental health issues like anxiety and depression. This means you might have people around you - friends, classmates at school, family members - who might be going through some of these mental health issues.
        Mental health, however, is a very stigmatized topic and does not easily make into our conversation in family, school or with friends.

            Access to Psychologists and CBT, however, can be expensive for most people. Most people, therefore, choose to live on with their mental health problems without seeking treatment.

            To help with this problem, a few developers designed an App called “Quirk”. So what is this Quirk app? Quirk is designed to be an aid in recording, becoming more aware of and changing your thought patterns - techniques used in CBT.
